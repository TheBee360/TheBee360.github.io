            <p style="word-wrap: break-word; line-height: 200%">During the summer after my junior year of high school, I was given the opportunity to join a small non-profit foundation. As a small group, our organization collected baseball equipment around the community and donated them to larger causes around the world, with the assistance of the U.S Air Force. Within our smaller group, my job consisted of mainting 
              <a href="https://www.baseballbuddies.org" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">www.baseballbuddies.org</a>
            , updating events accordingly, and debugging aspects of the site to ensure the best user experience.<br>

                    With the growing urge for our cause, I was tasked with developing a desktop application in Python that would enable us to organize our equipment much more efficiently. With the app, we could now visualize how much of each item we had and whether we were capable of donating enough or not. Overall, it was a great experience contributing toward a great cause and helping a local foundation!

The business would have many orders for neighboring schools, public universities/businesses and we had to manage the whole process. I was given the opportunity to be the webmaster, alongside a member of the board, where I would contribute to vital marketing decisions. My work on 
              <a href="https://www.insaneink.com" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">www.insaneink.com</a>
            included general upkeep, debugging/cleaning up code, and communicating with other departments.<br>

                   Additionally, I went above and beyond by revamping the site navigation bar (with a drop-down), adding a customer feedback form that would send responses directly to Google Sheets, as well as various other technical improvements to the site. At the end of the year, I was given an academic award for my outstanding work on the site. My time in Insane Ink was a valuable experience, as I learned a lot about front-end development and being a business leader.

              As my second quarter of college began, I felt quite bored of the usual routine. I had gotten so used to attending class, doing work, studying for the next exam, and repeating the process. Especially with the pandemic, I felt the need to meet new people and a great way to do that was to get involved in the UCSC Google Developers Club.
              <br><br>
              Getting into a larger group of 4-6 individuals, I joined a team to participate in the Google Solution Challenge 2021. Our project idea was to build an application called "Slug Maps" that could help students navigate, be informed of sustainable spots, and be quite resourceful of our vast college campus. This project was rather unique, as we were prompted to use industry developer tools made available by Google.

              <br> 

              <div class="span4 collapse-group">
                  <p class="collapse" style="word-wrap: break-word; line-height: 200%">
                    
                     After a period of time spent deciding on what Google Developer Tools to use, we decided that the Google Maps API and Firebase (which we were given access to through Google Cloud) would best serve our needs. For UI/UX Design we were set on using the popular tool Figma, which was extremely efficient and easy to use from a developer standpoint. For the development process, we would be using the IDE Android Studio, which had a mobile device emulator (Android and IOS) for testing purposes.
                     <br><br>
                     The challenge in this project was mainly learning how to use industry tools/technology. As I went through the wonderful documentation provided by Google on each set of tools, I found myself struggling to grasp an understanding of what I was doing. However, after much experimentation and research, I was able to follow up and get everything set up properly. Throughout the development process, I ran into numerous bugs and errors, mainly in terms of software dependencies, program structure, and authentication. I was in charge of integrating the Google Maps API within our app, which required sufficient knowledge of the authentication process (i.e. API keys), as well as the Flutter Framework. There were certain syntax guidelines in Dart that I was not familiar with in previous languages, so I spent a portion of my time figuring out how code behaved and why. Furthermore, I went above and beyond trying to understand what my team members were doing, so that I can be informed and better prepared of the entire technology stack.
                     <br><br>
                     This project was definately much more challenging than anything I had done before. Working with industry developer tools was a great experience preparing for the real world and a great opportunity to work on real world solutions. In the end we were able to bring our amazing idea to life, while having fun and meeting new people!

              As a freshman in college, especially with the boredom that comes with being in quarantine, I decided it was prime time I renovate my personal website. My old website was just pure hardcoded HTML/CSS, which was very problematic due to the possibility it would break on certain devices (mobile for example) and how difficult it was to comprehend what I wrote. In addition, the hardcoded HTML was a huge mess and clearly needed more organization toward the ease of updating the site in the future.

                     I decided to utilize the library Bootstrap for my new website. This library was extremely efficient, as I would just need to focus on how I would organize my page's layout and design. The prebuilt buttons, image properties, text modifications, and much more made it convenient versus hardcoding pure CSS. With knowledge of Bootstrap, and HTML/CSS/JS my website was ready for a fresh new look!

              As a student in high school and college, coursework has always been an important part of my success in academics. Now with the growing reliance on the internet, many classes shifted to online resources and require multiple sites to be used toward class and homework. With the numerous tabs needed for many of my classes, I became frustrated with having to open and close all of them when either I changed subjects or finished my work for the day. Thus, I decided to put my coding skills to the test and drafted a program that automatically saves my tabs into "packages" that I can organize and reopen whenever I wanted. The user interphase allows ease of access to these packages and in the end I had created a project that was not only enriching, but useful for my everyday tasks.

              <br> 

              <div class="span4 collapse-group">
                  <p class="collapse" style="word-wrap: break-word; line-height: 200%">
                    
                     Now as the typical task would have, many challenges came with implementing this solution. Since I did not have the best knowledge of databases, I had to deal with JSON files and learning how to intake data similar to that of File IO operations. Numerous algorithms were written to handle data, while access to data values required some precision in code. Since I was not able to access my browser, I had to work around this issue with automation in Python using the PyWinAuto library. In addition, I had to learn how to design the UI in a practical and efficient manner so nothing breaks on the software side. This project presented a series of technical challenges, but was totally worth it with the end product!
